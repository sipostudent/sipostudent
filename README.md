## About Me

With experience in <b>fast-moving consumer goods product management, server-side development (Python, PHP, SQL), interactive front-end development (JavaScript)</b>, I am familiar with the different stages of the product and software development life cycles.

Experience collaborating directly with clients, partners, distributors, and resellers to solve their issues and fulfil their needs by facilitating the provision of bespoke consulting and development through internal and external product development and strategic alliances.

I aim to stay within the field of digital asset management and/or software development while learning more skills to help me move up in the fast-paced technology sector.

Education-wise, I hold an <b>MBA in Business Administration and Management, General</b>, enhancing my knowledge of the primary functional areas of business management, including strategy, marketing, finance, and organisational change. I am also taking an <b>MSc in Computer Science with Software Engineering</b> (Class of 2023).
