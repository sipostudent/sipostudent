**About**

As a former product manager for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) turned full-stack developer, I am knowledgeable in various phases of the product and software development lifecycles (PDLC and SDLC).

Education-wise, I hold an MBA in Business Administration and Management and am enrolled in an MSc programme in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

With experience developing web applications in JavaScript and Python, my focus is on blockchain development. Working with the Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols, building projects for real-world applications, and gaining the necessary skills for a career in this dynamic space.

Notable areas of knowledge include, but are not limited to the following:

- Database Systems---SQL, PostgreSQL, CRUD, Relations, JOINs, Subqueries, Window Functions, Partitions, Data Cleaning, DDL, DML, Relational and Non-Relational Databases

- Full-Stack Web Development---HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, React.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Django, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes, Testing, Code Debugging

- Product Management---knowledge includes planning, budget management, and coordinating all project working parts; assessing customer desires and requirements to generate a product that meets those standards; and determining product specifications, production timelines, and in-depth product development plans.
