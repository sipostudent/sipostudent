**About**

As a former product manager for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) turned full-stack developer, I am knowledgeable in various phases of the product and software development lifecycles (PDLC and SDLC).

Education-wise, I hold an MBA in Business Administration and Management and am enrolled in an MSc programme in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

With experience developing web applications in JavaScript and Python, my main goal is to keep working on projects that have real-world applicability and learn more skills that will help me grow my career in this fast-paced field.

Notable areas of knowledge include, but are not limited to the following:

- Full-Stack Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Django, Flask. Able to design, build, and deploy APIs and web applications.

- Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Product Management: This includes planning, budgeting, and coordinating all project components; analyzing customer desires and requirements in order to develop a product that meets those standards; and establishing product specifications, production timelines, and detailed product development plans.
