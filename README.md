## 🚀 About Me

I design infrastructures that **protect data, reduce risk, and scale with resilience**.  
I engineer **secure, distributed, and scalable systems** by combining blockchain engineering, cybersecurity practices, and systems architecture to align technology with business and compliance goals.

- <span aria-hidden="true">🔐</span> **Secure by design** — delivered with compliance awareness (GDPR/HIPAA).
- <span aria-hidden="true">⚡</span> **Scalable in practice** — tested with blockchain frameworks (Hyperledger, Ethereum testnets) and distributed storage (IPFS).
- <span aria-hidden="true">🎯</span> **Strategically aligned** — informed by MSc technical depth and MBA strategic insight.

_Now:_ focusing on secure-by-design distributed workflows and resilience testing in blockchain-based systems.
